# CDC Wonder Drug Overdose Analysis

## Project Description

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) have reported a record 93,000 drug overdose deaths across the United States for the year 2020. This is an unprecedented 30% increase over the previous year 2019, and has been mostly attributed to the many mental health stressors and uncertainties associated to COVID-19 and to the larger availability of lethal illicit synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Other national, state, and local public health agencies have reported similarly dramatic increases in non-fatal drug overdoses and requests for emergency medical services, in the months after March 2020.
