# CDC Wonder Drug Overdose Analysis

## Project Description

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) have reported a record 93,000 drug overdose deaths across the United States for the year 2020. This is an unprecedented 30% increase over the previous year 2019, and has been mostly attributed to the many mental health stressors and uncertainties associated to COVID-19 and to the larger availability of lethal illicit synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Other national, state, and local public health agencies have reported similarly dramatic increases in non-fatal drug overdoses and requests for emergency medical services, in the months after March 2020. 

This repository contains different notebooks that we used to examine trends in drug overdose deaths by gender, race, and geography in the United States during the period 2013-2020.
